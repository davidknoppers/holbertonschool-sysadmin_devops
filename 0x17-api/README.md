In this task we improve our familiarity with APIs by writing Python scripts
to interact with the JSON Placeholder API. Yes, it's a practice API!

In task 0, we pull to-do lists from the server's employee data.

In task 1, we do the same but also export our results to CSV.

Task 2 is also similar to task 0 except this time we export to JSON.

Task 3 is an extension of task 2 where instead of pulling tasks for one employee,
we pull for all of them!
