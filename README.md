# holbertonschool-sysadmin_devops
Welcome to my sysadmin_devops repo!
**Folders 0-5** are basic shell scripting tasks completed towards the beginning
of Holberton School.
**Folders 6, 7, 0E and OF** are folders where we work on the basics of web
networking. That usually involves a mi of quiz questions and basic scripts.
**Any folder with web_stack_debugging in the name** is an exerise wherein we
ssh into a Docker container set up by the Holberton mentors. Typically it will
be some sort of malfunctioning web server and our task is to debug it. The
command in the repo will be the line we ultimately used to fix the server.
